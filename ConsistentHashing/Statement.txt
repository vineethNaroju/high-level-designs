It is important to distribute load evenly to achieve horizontal scaling
Say we have N cache servers, then we can get serverIndex as Hash(key) % N.
It works well if server pool size is fixed but not if server is either added or removed.
Most of the keys will get redistributed and not just the removed server (since N -> N-1).
This increases Cache miss rate and puts heavy load on each cache server.
